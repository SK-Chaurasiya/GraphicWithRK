Personal web pages are World Wide Web pages created by an individual to contain content of a personal nature rather than content about a company, organization, or institution. Personal web pages are primarily used for informative or entertainment purposes but can also be used for personal career marketing (by containing a list of the individual's skills, experience, and a CV), social networking with other people with shared interests, or as a space for personal expression.

Graphics (from Ancient Greek γραφικός (graphikós) 'about drawing, painting, writing, etc.') are visual images or designs on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, screen, paper, or stone, to inform, illustrate, or entertain. In contemporary usage, it includes a pictorial representation of data, as in design and manufacture, in typesetting and the graphic arts, and educational and recreational software. Images that are generated by a computer are called computer graphics.
